```

Or build from source:

```bash

### Configuration

Config file at `~/.config/vex/config.toml`:

```toml
token = "ghp_..."  # optional — falls back to `gh auth token`
selected_cli = "opencode"  # optional — for Ctrl+e launcher (auto-detected in settings)
[[projects]]
name = "my-project"
path = "/home/user/projects/my-project"
owner = "myuser"
repo = "my-repo"
```

Projects are added automatically via the dashboard (`a` → file browser). Use `e` on a project to edit its path. Configure the CLI launcher via `Ctrl+g` settings screen.

### Quick Capture

```bash
vex add "Fix the login bug" --body "Investigate the auth flow" --priority high
```
